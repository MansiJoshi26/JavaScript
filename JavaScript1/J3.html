    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> DATA TYPES <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
     In JS,  data types mean the type of value a variable can hold.
    
     There are mainly 2 types of data types :  1. Primitive  data types  (simple values.)
                                               2. Non Primitive data types (Complex Data Types)


    ##################### 1. PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES: #####################
    1. NUMBERS: JavaScript has one type of number â€” Number.
       Example: 10, 99.5, -200
                     
    2. String : A string can hold any kind of text.
                 Strings are enclosed in single quotes (') or double quotes (").
        Examples: "Hello", 'Chetna', "1234"

    3. Booleans: Represents a true or false value.
        Examples: true, false
     Boolean values are often used to check conditions like yes/no or on/off.

    4. Undefine : A variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value yet.
        Example: let x;
          When you declare a variable but do not give it a value, 
          JavaScript automatically assigns it the value undefined.
    5. BigInt: Used for representing large numbers that cannot be stored as regular Number type.
        Example: 89n
          BigInt is used when working with numbers too large for the normal Number data type in JavaScript.



          ##################### 2. Non Primitive data types   #####################
                That can hold collections of data, like objects and arrays.

1. Object: collection of key-value pairs.
Example: { name: "Chetna", age: 22 }
Objects allow you to store multiple related values together.
                    let person = { name: "abc", age: 22 };
                    console.log(person.name);       // abc
                    console.log(person.age);        // 22

2.  Array:  list of values.( Array ek aisa variable hota hai jo ek saath kai values store kar sakta hai.)

 *****************  What Can You Store in an Array?  *****************  
 You can store:
~Numbers
~Strings (text)               let mixArray = [10, "Hello", true, null];
~Booleans (true/false)
~Null, Undefined
~Even a mix of different types!       

3. Function:  A block of code that can be called to run at any time.
Example: function greet() { 
console.log("Hello!"); 
}
Functions allow you to reuse code by calling the function when you need it.
                          function greet() {
                              console.log("Hello!");
                                     }
                             greet();  // Output: Hello!

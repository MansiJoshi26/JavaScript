     What are Variables?
     In JavaScript, variables are used to store data. They are an essential part of any programming language,
      as they allow you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in your programs.
    >>>>>>> There are 2 types of variable in JS: I. LOCAL VARIABLE 
                                                 II. GLOBAL VARIABLE
    _____________________________________________________________________________________________
    1. LOCAL VARIABLE : JS local variable is declared inside block or function. 
    it can accessible within the funtion or block only.
                                      <script> 
                                         function abc(){
                                          var x=10;       // local varibale
                                         }
                                     </scrpt>
    
    2. GLOBAL VARIABLE : JS global variable is accessible from any function. A variable i.e declared outside 
    the function .
                                    <script>
                                        var abc=200;       // global variable
                                        function a(){
                                             }
                                    </scrpt> 
     
    **********RULES FOR DECLARING VARIABLE*****************
    1. name must start with letter(a to z or A to Z), underscore(_) or dollar($) sign.
    2. After first letter we can use digits(0 to 9). ex: value1
    3. JS variable are case sensitive.
      
    
    **********************In JavaScript, you can declare variables in 3 ways:*********************
    
    1. var        2.let               3.const
    
    >>>>>> 1 var :-------
    
    This is the old way to make a variable.
    You can use it anywhere inside the function where you made it.
    You can change its value anytime.
    You can also declare it again.
    
    2. let :-------
    This is the new and better way.
    You can use it only inside the block {} where you made it.
    You can change its value.
    But you cannot declare it again in the same block.
    
    3. const :-------
    This is for a value that should never change.
    You must give it a value when you make it.
    You cannot change it later.
    It also works only inside the block {} where you made it.
